# MY-Portfolio


Hi, I'm Hasan YILMAZ
{Senior Software Development Engineer}
Dear reader

I am a software lover and software engineer who loves green and nature, drowning in the big densities of big cities; a software lover and software engineer who will squeeze PHP and Go among the must-haves. I am writing to share my story and my hopes for the future.

I was born and raised in Arhavi district of Artvin province in Turkey. I grew up speaking Lazuri, the local language of the region. I completed my primary and high school education in Istanbul. I graduated from the Web Design and Programming department in 2011. I continued my education at Samsun 19 Mayıs University and completed my associate degree in Computer Programming in 2013. Then I transferred to Eskişehir Anadolu University and completed my undergraduate education by graduating from the Computer Engineering department in 2015. I also completed my second undergraduate education by completing the Business Administration department within the scope of the second university.

Since graduating, I have worked as a software engineer in various companies. I have developed web applications using various technologies such as PHP, Go and React. I am also proficient in using cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.

In my work, I always try to use my skills to make a positive impact within the company or on myself.

That's all, thanks for reading and taking the time.
